"""Tool definitions for the CHIMERA-Agent baseline.

Two registries — one per task — are exposed by the MCP server. Each
:class:`~chimera_agent_baseline.tools.base.ToolSpec` lists the fields
from the per-case ``clinical.json`` it returns.

The tools mirror the masked "Extended EHR view" sections of the
urologist forms: the structured "Clinical data" panel is rendered into
the prompt up front, while the documents below were hidden behind a
click and so must be actively requested. Each tool returns its
``clinical.json`` field value directly.

To add a custom tool, append a new ``ToolSpec`` to the appropriate
registry below.
